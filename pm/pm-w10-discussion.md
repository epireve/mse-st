# Planning and Structuring the Systematic Literature Review on Team Dynamics

**Date of Meeting:** Wednesday, 28th May 2025

**Time of Meeting:** 20:00:00 Malaysia Time

**Attendees:** Azfar, Cris, Yalini and Firdaus.

**Key Topics/Content Covered:** The meeting centered on planning the alternative assessment for the Software Project Management course, specifically a systematic literature review (SLR) on team dynamics. Discussions covered clarifying the scope of the review (including team dynamics, burnout, and communication as interrelated topics), the current status of paper collection and processing via EndNote, and the decision to potentially use the PRISMA methodology. The team also explored using ChatGPT to generate a structural outline and a tabular format for analyzing and presenting findings, and began to discuss task delegation for writing the paper.

## Topics/Themes

*   Project Scope Clarification (Alternative Assessment on Team Dynamics)
*   Paper Collection, Processing, and EndNote Management
*   Methodology for Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
*   Utilizing AI (ChatGPT) for Planning and Structuring
*   Task Delegation and Contribution Strategy
*   Proposed Structure and Tabular Outline for the Review

## Key Points

*   **Regarding Project Scope Clarification (Alternative Assessment on Team Dynamics):**
    *   The assessment is for **Software Project Management**.
    *   The initial topic chosen was related to **team dynamics, burnout, and communication**.
    *   The **Doctor split the initial broad topic**, focusing on team dynamics and associated challenges in a systematic review.
    *   Clarification from the Doctor (via screenshot) indicated a need to **focus on more than one dynamic** as they are interrelated, covering an overall spectrum rather than just one specific type.
    *   The team acknowledged the theoretical nature and complexity of "team dynamics."

*   **Regarding Paper Collection, Processing, and EndNote Management:**
    *   **Cris** has compiled a set of papers, filtering them down (e.g., to 16 in one instance).
    *   **Firdaus** has also processed some papers (around 6) by reading, taking notes, and highlighting content for analysis, with 36 more papers to process.
    *   There's a need to process all collected papers into a **tabular format**, similar to what was done for Research Methodology last semester.
    *   **Yalini** confirmed she has EndNote installed but needed access to the shared paper library. **Cris** was to facilitate this.
    *   The team discussed the current number of papers and whether it's sufficient, concluding that this can only be determined after all papers are processed.

*   **Regarding Methodology for Systematic Literature Review (SLR):**
    *   The team discussed adopting an **SLR method**.
    *   **PRISMA** (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) was identified as a potential framework.
        *   PRISMA involves a **checklist** and a **flow diagram**.
        *   It is considered **rigorous** and **exhaustive**.
    *   The team considered the effort involved, aiming for a worthy approach given time constraints.

*   **Regarding Utilizing AI (ChatGPT) for Planning and Structuring:**
    *   The team decided to use **ChatGPT (specifically mentioning version 4.5)** to get ideas and structure for the paper.
    *   They planned to input the **alternate assessment PDF** and the project's themes into ChatGPT.
    *   A prompt was formulated to ask ChatGPT for clarity on the topic, how to tackle it, and to plot ideas based on the provided context and themes (e.g., "Systematic review of Team Dynamics in Software Development Projects: Challenges and Mitigation Strategies").
    *   ChatGPT provided an 8-point structure: Introduction, Methodology, Thematic Analysis, Findings, Gaps, Common Challenges, etc.
    *   A follow-up prompt asked ChatGPT to suggest a **tabular outline** for the study, including citations and key findings per theme.

*   **Regarding Task Delegation and Contribution Strategy:**
    *   A general discussion on how to segregate tasks for writing the journal article.
    *   **Azfar** expressed concerns about his limited time and unfamiliarity with the detailed paper content, initially suggesting **Cris** handle the thematic analysis due to his deeper engagement with the papers.
    *   Thematic analysis would involve identifying common challenges and gaps from the papers.
    *   **Azfar** proposed to take on the **methodology, introduction, and discussion sections** after the thematic analysis is produced.
    *   The importance of **everyone being involved** was emphasized.

*   **Regarding Proposed Structure and Tabular Outline for the Review:**
    *   ChatGPT suggested a structure including:
        *   Introduction
        *   Methodology (specifying the SLR framework like PRISMA)
        *   Thematic Analysis (identifying recurring themes like communication, role ambiguity, burnout, psychological safety, conflict, collaboration)
        *   Findings (summary of key findings from reviewed articles for each theme)
        *   Discussion (interpreting findings, implications, limitations)
        *   Conclusion
        *   Recommendations
    *   ChatGPT also provided a **tabular outline format** with columns for Theme, Sub-theme, Key Findings/Insights, Supporting Articles (Citation), and Challenges/Gaps Noted.
    *   The team found this tabular outline helpful and planned to use it.
    *   The AI's output also broke down "Team Dynamics" into sub-themes like **Communication, Role Ambiguity, Burnout, Psychological Safety, Team Cohesion, Conflict Resolution, Flexibility, and Collaboration**.

## Action Plan / Next Steps

*   [ ] Grant **Yalini** access to the shared EndNote library.
*   [ ] Continue processing remaining papers, taking notes and highlighting key content.
*   [ ] Continue filtering and processing selected papers.
*   [ ] Process all selected papers and populate a shared tabular format (similar to the one from Research Methodology or the ChatGPT suggested one).
*   [ ] Formally decide on and adopt the **PRISMA methodology** for the SLR, including creating a checklist and flow diagram.
*   [ ] Conduct the **thematic analysis** of the processed papers, identifying common themes, challenges, and gaps.
*   [ ] Draft the **Introduction, Methodology, and Discussion** sections of the paper, based on the thematic analysis and overall findings.
*   [ ] Share the ChatGPT session link or the generated tabular outline with the team (e.g., copy-paste into the group chat).
*   [ ] Collaboratively populate the **ChatGPT-suggested tabular outline** with findings from the papers.
*   [ ] Once papers are processed, evaluate if the current number of papers is sufficient for an exhaustive review.
*   [ ] Ensure active involvement and contribution in the writing process.
