### **1. Introduction to Week 5 Topics**
- **Overview of Week 5:**  
  - Covered **Project Scope Management**, focusing on defining and managing the project scope.  
  - Discussed tools and techniques for scope management, including **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**, **Responsibility Matrix**, and **Communication Plan**.  

- **Key Focus Areas:**  
  - **Project Scope:** Defining the project’s objectives, deliverables, and boundaries.  
  - **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks.  
  - **Responsibility Matrix:** Assigning roles and responsibilities to team members.  
  - **Communication Plan:** Ensuring effective communication among stakeholders.  

---

### **2. Defining the Project Scope**
- **Project Scope:**  
  - A clear definition of the project’s objectives, deliverables, and boundaries.  
  - **Purpose of Scope Statement:**  
    - Clearly defines deliverables for the end user.  
    - Focuses the project on successful completion of its goals.  
    - Serves as a planning tool and for measuring project success.  

- **Project Scope Checklist:**  
  - Project objective.  
  - Deliverables.  
  - Milestones.  
  - Technical requirements.  
  - Limits and exclusions.  
  - Reviews with the customer.  

---

### **3. Establishing Project Priorities**
- **Project Trade-offs:**  
  - Balancing **Scope, Time, and Cost** to meet project objectives.  
  - **Causes of Trade-offs:**  
    - Shifts in the relative importance of cost, time, and performance parameters.  

- **Managing Trade-offs:**  
  - **Constrain:** Fixing a parameter as a requirement.  
  - **Enhance:** Optimizing one criterion over others.  
  - **Accept:** Reducing or not meeting a criterion requirement.  

- **Project Management Trade-offs:**  
  - **Scope:** What is included in the project.  
  - **Cost:** The budget allocated for the project.  
  - **Time:** The schedule for project completion.

### **4. Creating the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**  
  - A hierarchical outline that identifies the products and work elements involved in a project.  
  - Defines the relationship of the final deliverable to its subdeliverables and work packages.  

- **How WBS Helps the Project Manager:**  
  - Facilitates evaluation of cost, time, and technical performance.  
  - Provides management with information appropriate to each organizational level.  
  - Helps in the development of the **Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS)**.  
  - Assists in managing the project plan, schedule, and budget.  

- **Work Packages:**  
  - The lowest level of the WBS.  
  - Output-oriented, defining **what, how long, cost, resources, who, and milestones**.  

---

### **5. Integrating the WBS with the Organization**
- **Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS):**  
  - Depicts how the firm is organized to discharge its work responsibility for a project.  
  - Provides a framework to summarize organizational unit performance.  
  - Identifies organizational units responsible for work packages.  
  - Ties organizational units to cost control accounts.  

- **Integration of WBS and OBS:**  
  - Ensures that each work package is assigned to the appropriate organizational unit.  
  - Facilitates monitoring and controlling of project progress.  

---

### **6. Coding the WBS for the Information System**
- **WBS Coding System:**  
  - Defines levels and elements of the WBS.  
  - Allows reports to be consolidated at any organizational level.  
  - Facilitates the integration of the WBS with the project’s information system.  

- **Example of WBS Coding:**  
  - **Level 1:** Project Title (e.g., "E-Slim Tablet x-13 Prototype").  
  - **Level 2:** Major Deliverables (e.g., "Hardware", "CPU").  
  - **Level 3:** Subdeliverables (e.g., "Power Supply", "Flash ROM").  
  - **Level 4:** Work Packages (e.g., "Battery", "Charger").  

---

### **7. Responsibility Matrices**
- **Responsibility Matrix (RM):**  
  - Summarizes tasks to be accomplished and who is responsible for what on the project.  
  - Clarifies critical interfaces between units and individuals that need coordination.  
  - Provides a means for all participants to view their responsibilities and agree on their assignments.  

- **Types of Responsibility Matrices:**  
  - **Linear Responsibility Chart:**  
    - Lists project activities and participants.  
    - Clarifies the extent or type of authority that can be exercised by each participant.  

- **Example of Responsibility Matrix:**  
  - **Responsibility Matrix for a Market Research Project:**  
    - Tasks: Identify target customers, Develop draft questionnaire, Pilot-test questionnaire, etc.  
    - Participants: Richard, Dan, Dave, Linda, Elizabeth.  
    - Roles: Responsible (R), Support (S).

### **8. Project Communication Plan**
- **Communication Plan:**  
  - Ensures effective communication among stakeholders.  
  - **Key Components:**  
    - **Information Needs:** What information needs to be collected and when.  
    - **Target Audience:** Who will receive the information.  
    - **Methods of Communication:** How information will be gathered and stored.  
    - **Timing:** When the information will be communicated.  

- **Example of a Communication Plan:**  
  - **Shale Oil Research Project Communication Plan:**  
    - **Milestone Report:** Bimonthly, via email and hardcopy, provided by the project office.  
    - **Project Status Reports:** Weekly, via email and hardcopy, provided by the project manager.  
    - **Team Status Reports:** Weekly, via email, provided by the team recorder.  
    - **Issues Report:** Weekly, via email, provided by the team recorder.  
    - **Escalation Reports:** When needed, via meeting and hardcopy, provided by the project manager.  
    - **Outsourcing Performance:** Bimonthly, via meeting, provided by the project manager.  
    - **Accepted Change Requests:** Anytime, via email and hardcopy, provided by the design department.  
    - **Oversight Gate Decisions:** As required, via email meeting report, provided by the oversight group or project office.
