**Topic 1 - Introduction to Academic Research**

**1.1 What is Research? (Defining the Pursuit of Knowledge)**

*   **The Act of Seeking:** Research, at its core, is the act of actively searching, investigating, and inquiring. It's not a passive absorption of information but a dynamic process of exploration. It involves systematic investigation and inquiry to discover and revise facts, theories, and applications. Instead of relying solely on intuition or common sense, research seeks to illuminate through evidence-based inquiry.
*   **Why Search?:** The motivation behind research stems from a fundamental human desire to understand the world around us and to resolve existing questions. This can be triggered by a gap in our understanding, a problem that requires a solution, an unresolved paradox, or simply a curiosity about a specific phenomenon.
*   **The Scientific Approach: More Than a Guess:** Academic research is not merely about finding some information, it goes beyond simple speculation and information gathering. It utilizes systematic methodologies and structured approaches to obtain reliable and valid data.
    *  This can be achieved through well-established quantitative methods that employ statistical analysis and measurement to produce results.
    * Or through qualitative methods, which seeks to explore the complexities of the topic using an inductive approach that values perspectives and experiences.
    * Academic research seeks to provide a rigorously designed investigation that can contribute to the existing knowledge.
*   **Beyond Simple Searching: The Process of Discovery:** True research includes a process of exploring ideas, interpreting facts, and generating new insights. It’s not enough to merely gather information; it involves critical thinking to find the hidden meaning within the topic. This process is essential for advancing knowledge and creating new and innovative insights.
*   **Originality: A Cornerstone of Research:** Originality is not about inventing something entirely from scratch. Instead, it is the cornerstone of new knowledge, and it can involve approaching a familiar topic from a new angle, synthesizing existing ideas in a novel way, and drawing new conclusions.
*   **Purpose of Academic Research: Building a Solid Foundation of Knowledge:** The primary purpose of academic research is to build upon the scientific knowledge base. It aims to enhance comprehension, explain how phenomena work, discover new relationships, and uncover meaningful insights through rigorous methodologies. It includes not just the discovery of new ideas but also the application of these findings to real-world problems and scenarios. It is critical for identifying problems, finding solutions, and creating evidence-based changes in practices or theories.
*   **The Nature of the Research Process: The Path of Scrutiny:** Academic research is not a solitary endeavor. It is an iterative and collaborative process that includes the sharing of findings with the broader scientific or professional community. The findings are published and reviewed by fellow researchers which allows them to critically examine and evaluate the validity and reliability of the reported results. This collaboration allows for feedback and further improvement of the study.

**1.2 Why Do We Need to Conduct Research? (The Value of Inquiry)**

*   **Personal Curiosity: An Inherent Desire:** At the heart of all research lies an inherent human desire to explore, understand, and make sense of the world.

The use of numerical analysis allows a researcher to create accurate, and generalizable research outcome.

**4.5 Characteristics of Quantitative Research (Core Tenets of the Approach)**

*   **Objectivity: Minimizing Bias:** Quantitative research strives for objectivity, where data is collected without any influence by the observer. The primary goal is to minimize bias and ensure that data reflects the true situation and not the opinions of the researcher.
*   **Structured Instruments: Standardized Tools for Measurement:** Specific instruments and tools are utilized to maintain consistency and accuracy of measurements across multiple data points and research participants. The use of structured tools also enables a consistent data collection across multiple research groups and individuals.
*   **Large Sample Sizes: For Generalizability:** The use of large sample sizes will ensure that the findings can be generalized to a wider population. Large-scale data collection provides more reliability to research outcomes by reducing errors and enabling greater generalizability.
*   **Reliability: Replicating the Results:**  Quantitative research emphasizes reliability, that the findings can be repeated and replicated with similar results, therefore strengthening the validity and reliability of the study.
*   **Clear Question: Focus on a Specific Area:** Quantitative research starts with well-defined questions, providing a specific framework for the entire research process. The research question is crucial for defining the variables to be measured, data collection processes, and the type of statistical analysis.
*   **Carefully Designed: From Planning to Analysis:** All aspects of the quantitative research are planned and well-defined from the initial planning stages to the analysis and conclusions to maximize the quality, validity and reliability of the research process.
*  **Numeric Data: The Language of Measurement:** Quantitative research utilizes numerical data, such as scores, measurements, or responses, to provide a base for statistical and mathematical analysis. This data is often represented using tables, charts, and figures.
*  **Generalization: The Power of Broad Applicability:** Quantitative research enables researchers to generalize their findings to wider populations and explore casual relationships between different variables.
*   **Data Collection: Employing Tools for Numerical Information:** Specific tools such as questionnaires, surveys, and software are used to collect numerical data that is used for analysis and comparison.

**4.6 Types of Quantitative Research (Classifications and Examples)**

*   **Experimental Research: Exploring Cause and Effect:** Experimental research uses a controlled setting, where researchers manipulate variables and randomly assign participants, in order to establish cause and effect relationships. This enables researchers to study specific variables by manipulating the environment and setting.
    *   **True-Experiment:** Random assignment of participants and the inclusion of a control group is the cornerstone of true experimentation. This design is the most rigorous, where the control group is not subjected to the manipulation being explored, while the experiment group does.
        *  **Example**: Studying the effect of music on a student’s performance, by assigning students to either a control group that studies without music or an experimental group that studies with music, and then comparing the academic performance between the groups.
        *  **Example**: Study the effect of junk food on obese people, by assigning people to a treatment group who will be fed only junk food and a control group who will continue with their regular diet. The data is then collected through testing and observation. However, such studies can be unethical as you can't force participants to eat only junk food.
     *  **Quasi-Experiment:** This type of experiment does not involve random assignments but instead focuses on groups of participants with specific characteristics. While the design is very similar to the true experiment, there are a few key differences.
         *  **Example**: Examining the use of a reading program for students who failed in a previous reading assessment.
         *   **Example**: Assessing the impact of a public health campaign, by comparing the data between areas where the campaign has been implemented and those that have not been.

*   **Descriptive (Non-Experimental) Research: Mapping the Current Landscape:** Descriptive research explores the current situation of variables without any manipulation from the researchers. Descriptive studies allow the researcher to identify the key factors in a study without imposing interventions or manipulating the variables.
    *   **Surveys:** A survey utilizes questionnaires and interviews to collect opinions, knowledge, and attitudes of a large population sample.
        *    **Example:** Measuring the influence of a new product by surveying user opinions and identifying their usage behaviour.
    *   **Correlational:** To establish the connection and extent of a relationship between two or more variables, by using statistical tools.
        *  **Example**: Evaluating the link between video gaming and the development of critical thinking skills of the players.
    *   **Cross-Sectional (Time):** In this study, data is collected at one specific point in time, providing a snapshot of the data at that moment in time.
        *    **Example:** Evaluating spending trends of individuals of different genders at a set time, for example, during the month of December.
    *   **Longitudinal (Time):** Longitudinal studies involve data collection at multiple points over time.
        *    **Example:** The effect of vaccination on a specific population, measuring the impact of the vaccine at different intervals.

**5.4 Focus Groups (In-depth Group Discussions)**

*   **What are they?:** Focus groups are a commonly used research method that involves guided discussions between a small group of participants that share a common demographic or background, which enables the group to engage with the topics more effectively.
*   **Goals:** The main goal is to facilitate discussion and provide answers to questions about what, why, and how.
*  **Cost:** Focus groups can be an expensive way to gather data, particularly in comparison with online techniques.
*   **Size:** A focus group should consist of six to ten participants, to allow for a lively discussion while maintaining a focus on specific issues.
*   **Composition:** Participants are carefully selected through a pre-screening process, to create a homogeneous group based on demographics, opinions, or background.
*   **Setting:** The setting must be relaxed and informal to encourage the participants to freely express their thoughts.
*   **Duration:** A single session can last from one to three hours, allowing the participants to explore the issues in detail.
*  **Recording:** To ensure all data is captured, the discussion must be recorded using audio or video equipment.
*   **Moderator:** A skilled moderator is necessary to keep the conversation going, manage the discussion, and ensure that all participants contribute.

**5.5 Conducting a Focus Group (The Key Steps)**
    *   **Design**: Careful planning and establishment of an ideal research environment that facilitates conversations.
    *   **Recruit**: Select participants based on clearly defined criteria to ensure that they are a good fit for the research topic.
    *   **Moderator**: Use a skillful and trained moderator to keep the discussion going and to manage the dynamics of the group.
    *   **Guide**: Create a guide for discussions, to maintain focus and consistency within the interview process.
    *   **Interview:** Conduct the interview in an open and honest manner to ensure the participants provide a true viewpoint on the research area.
    *   **Report**: Generate a summary report of the key findings from the focus group discussion.

**5.6 Depth Interviews (In-depth Conversations)**

*   **Common Method:** Depth interviews are a common qualitative method that utilizes one-on-one conversations for gathering insights.
*  **Unstructured Approach:** They follow an unstructured approach, similar to focus groups, enabling the researchers to explore topics without adhering to a fixed script or questionnaire.
*   **One-on-One:** These interviews are conducted on a one-on-one basis, allowing the researcher to focus on a single participant at a time and gather more in-depth feedback.
*  **Duration:** The interviews can typically range from thirty minutes to over an hour, providing time for a detailed exploration of all research topics.
*   **Purpose:** The focus of the depth interview is to explore underlying motives and viewpoints related to a sensitive topic. It uncovers hidden perspectives and enables the researcher to engage the participant in an open and frank manner.
*  **Probing:** Depth interviews utilize probing questions that allows the interviewer to explore attitudes, thoughts, and feelings by asking clarifying questions, encouraging participants to share their thoughts in more detail.

**5.7 Focus Group vs. Depth Interviews (Key Differences)**

*   **Group Synergy:** In focus groups the group dynamics helps create new perspectives, ideas and viewpoints that may not be evident from a one on one session. Conversely, depth interviews provide a deeper exploration of an individual's viewpoint without any influence from other people.
*   **Influence:** Focus groups can be influenced by group dynamics and peer pressure, which may sometimes make it difficult to gain an accurate view of individual perspectives. Depth interviews on the other hand are free of this limitation.
*   **Client Involvement:** If the client needs to be part of the study, depth interviews are preferred since focus groups can become disruptive and limit the overall results.
*   **Idea Generation:** Focus groups are better at idea generation where there is a creative discussion between a group of people. Depth interviews, on the other hand, provides deeper insight into a specific individual's opinions and views.
*   **Sensitive Topics:** Depth interviews are preferable when discussing sensitive issues as participants may be reluctant to share such information in a group.
*   **Competitors and Professionals:** Professionals or competitors are easier to interview on a one on one basis since it is easier to gain their viewpoint in a structured and more focused way.
*  **Scheduling:** Depth interviews can be easier to schedule because a focus group requires coordination with multiple participants.
*   **Information:** Focus groups can often lead to more information as it involves a discussion between multiple individuals. However, this can also lead to a lack of depth, which is better addressed through a depth interview.
*   **Moderation Bias**: Due to the presence of a moderator, focus groups are prone to moderator bias. Depth interviews on the other hand, are more open with less pressure from a group dynamics.
*   **Cost:** Focus groups tend to be more costly due to the logistical issues in coordinating with multiple participants, and the cost of the moderator, and other resources. Depth interviews on the other hand are more cost effective and easier to organise.

**5.8 Ethnographic Research (Immersive Observation in Natural Settings)**

*   **Observational Method:** Ethnography provides an in-depth observational approach that studies people and settings in their natural environment, rather than the controlled settings. It explores the topic without any direct intervention by the researcher.
*   **Adaptable Approach:** A core requirement for ethnography is that researchers must adapt to the target environment and adjust their approaches to fit the needs and characteristics of the study area.
*   **Geographical Constraints:** Ethnography can be challenged by geographical constraints, especially when studying people in remote regions, or settings that are difficult to access.
*   **Natural Setting**: Ethnography values gathering information from the natural settings of the research, and refrains from using surveys, interviews or other forms of artificial data collection.

**5.9 Case Study (In-Depth Exploration of a Specific Instance)**
