**Topic 1 - Introduction to Academic Research**

**1.1 What is Research?**

*   **The Act of Seeking:** At its core, research is the act of searching or inquiring. It's about actively seeking answers and insights through investigation. It moves beyond casual information gathering and involves a structured and focused approach.

*   **Why Search?:** The process of research is often driven by a need to understand something we're unsure about. This might be a phenomenon, a problem, or an uncertainty that requires further investigation.

*   **The Scientific Approach:** Academic research goes beyond simply seeking answers. It utilizes systematic methodologies, ensuring that information obtained is reliable, valid, and supported by either quantitative or qualitative data.

*   **Beyond Simple Searching:** True research involves more than simply gathering information. It often requires interpreting findings in a new and innovative way, leading to original conclusions. This process is essential for advancing knowledge in various fields.

*   **Originality:** Originality is the foundation of new knowledge within research, which involves looking at things differently and reaching conclusions not previously attained.

*   **Purpose of Academic Research:** To build upon the scientific knowledge base. It aims to understand relationships, explain phenomena, and discover new insights using rigorous methodologies.
    *   It is critical for identifying problems and finding solutions by collecting and analyzing evidence.

*   **The Nature of the Research Process:** Academic research isn’t a solitary process; it also includes the sharing of findings with the broader scientific or professional community, which allows a rigorous evaluation of the validity and reliability of the research results.

**1.2 Why Do We Need to Conduct Research?**

*   **Descriptive:** Describe characteristics of specific topics.
*   **Exploratory:** Explore a new topic and look for gaps in literature.
*   **Explanatory:** Establish cause-effect relationship among different variables.
*   **Causal:** Investigate cause and effect relationships.
*   **Normative:** Research to establish or influence standards, guidelines, or desired outcomes.
*   **Empirical:** Gathering data through experiments.
*   **Problem-Solving:** Research to offer solutions to practical problems.
*  **Development and application studies:** Study and develop applications of solutions.

**7.8 Experimental Techniques**

*   **Quantitative Testing:** Experiments of algorithms/programs/databases, etc.
