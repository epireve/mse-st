# Project Finalization: Report, Coding, and Presentation Planning

**Date of Meeting:** Tuesday, 3 June 2025

**Time of Meeting:** 21:38 H Malaysia Time

**Attendees:** Cris, Yalini, Amirah, Norah, Firdaus, Azfar

**Key Topics/Content Covered:** The meeting focused on strategizing the completion of a system development project, covering the finalization of coding, preparation of a comprehensive report, and planning for the presentation. Key discussions included delegating the remaining coding tasks, with **Firdaus** aiming for 80% completion before wider contribution. The team meticulously reviewed the report structure, assigned sections based on project rubrics (including literature review, module fulfillment, UI/UX, architecture, and database), and decided against deploying the application due to no explicit requirement or additional marks. A follow-up meeting was scheduled for the 18th to discuss the presentation once the report is near completion.

## Key Points

*   **Regarding Project Status and Overall Strategy:**
    *   The project involves a system that is described as "slightly complex" with many requirements to fulfill for both the system and the report.
    *   The immediate focus is on finalizing the system to enable report generation and then preparing the presentation.
    *   The team needs to ensure all modules and functions are complete and align with the project requirements.

*   **Regarding Coding Development and Contribution Plan:**
    *   **Firdaus** has currently completed approximately **70%** of the coding.
    *   **Firdaus** plans to push the code progress to **80%** and then open it up for contributions from other team members.
    *   The code is already available on **GitHub** in a public repository.
    *   Team members interested in contributing to the code:
        *   **Amirah** initially showed interest but is now more inclined towards the report, though willing to help with coding if necessary.
        *   **Chris** also showed interest, but later volunteered for the literature review part of the report.
        *   **Azfar** volunteered to contribute to the coding.
    *   **Firdaus** will figure out how to segregate the remaining coding tasks, potentially by UI parts or specific sections, and inform who needs to be involved in which part.
    *   It was emphasized that understanding the system (and thus participating in or reviewing the code) is crucial for generating an accurate report.
    *   All team members are encouraged to install the app locally to view and understand it.

*   **Regarding Report Content, Structure, and Task Delegation:**
    *   A draft report already exists in **Google Docs**, which **Nora** shared.
    *   **Nora** was asked to upload the latest version to Google Docs to enable live, simultaneous editing by all team members.
    *   The report structure includes: Introduction, Objective, Model Function, UI Draft, and a framework discussion (initially MVC, corrected to Django's **MTV - Model Template View**).
    *   The team aims for a high grade ("A") by fulfilling all requirements.
    *   **Report Sections and Assignments based on Rubrics:**
        *   **Introduction:** (Problem, Goal, Objective, supported by references)
            *   Requires a **literature review** (finding relevant papers, synthesizing them, identifying gaps, and including citations).
            *   **Chris** volunteered for the literature review, focusing on the business case (B2B), current practice problems, and aligning with project goals/objectives.
        *   **Fulfillment of Modules and Function:** (All modules function, complete with additional features, cross-check with app)
            *   Need to ensure modules match the application and remove unnecessary ones from the proposal to create a simplified system.
            *   Requirement: At least **4 modules**, each with **3-5 functions**. (e.g., User management: register account, reset password).
            *   The team needs to recall any specific feedback from the "doctor" regarding creativity or other requirements.
            *   **Firdaus** volunteered to take this section.
        *   **UI/UX:** (Design elements, consistency, fitting purpose, prototype, screenshots)
            *   **Azfar** volunteered for this section.
        *   **Framework and Plan Implementation (Architecture):** (e.g., MTV for Django, explanation, examples, references)
            *   **Azfar** volunteered for this section.
        *   **Database:** (Explicit tables, fields, correct dummy records, explanation)
            *   **Amirah** volunteered for this section.
        *   **Complexity:** (System is sufficiently complex, how it's explained in the report)
            *   This will be addressed by explaining the system's moving parts.
        *   **Report Writing and Formatting:** (Table of contents, overall structure, clarity)
            *   **Yalini** volunteered for formatting (including Table of Contents).
            *   **Azfar** volunteered for overall report writing (checking).
    *   **Azfar** will create an outline for the report in Google Docs after the meeting to structure the content.

*   **Regarding Presentation Planning and Logistics:**
    *   The presentation will be discussed after the report is completed.
    *   A meeting is scheduled for the **18th** (next week) to specifically discuss the presentation.
    *   The presentation is due in **Week 14** (approximately 20 days from the meeting).
    *   The method of presentation (e.g., pre-recorded, live) is still undecided by the "doctor." The team needs to ask for clarification in the next class.

*   **Regarding Project Deployment Decision:**
    *   The question was raised whether the application needs to be deployed live.
    *   There is **no explicit requirement** or marks allocated for deployment, making it optional.
    *   **Firdaus** mentioned having a domain, but the team discussed free deployment options if pursued.
    *   The priority is to ensure the system is **fully functional**.
    *   A vote was taken: **Chris (No), Yalini (No), Amirah (No), Firdaus (No), Azfar (No)**.
    *   **Decision:** The team decided **not to deploy** the project.

*   **Regarding Coordination and Next Steps:**
    *   All team members are to keep their progress updated in the group chat to ensure everyone is on the same page.
    *   Everyone needs to install the application on their system to facilitate report writing.
    *   **Azfar** will create an outline with checkboxes for tasks in Google Docs to track progress.
    *   The team will meet on the **18th** to review report completion and discuss the presentation.
