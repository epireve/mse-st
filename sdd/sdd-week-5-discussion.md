Okay, here is a summary of your team discussion, including key points, details, and the action plan based on the transcript provided.

**Overall Summary**

The team met to discuss the web development project, focusing on preparations for the Week 7 presentation/activity and planning the next steps. They reviewed the required components for Week 7 (Introduction, Function List, UI Mockups), discussed the current state of the UI, and decided to simplify certain non-core features (like SMS/email opt-ins) by making them non-functional initially. Tasks for completing the remaining UI mockups were assigned. The team agreed to start the coding phase incrementally, with Firdaus initiating the Git repository and the Admin module foundation. Collaboration methods like VS Code Live Share were briefly discussed. Nora and Amira were designated as co-leads for coordination. The next meeting is scheduled for Tuesday to review progress on the assigned tasks.

**Key Points**

*   **Week 7 Requirements:** Need to finalize Introduction, Function List (clarified as project requirements/features), and UI mockups.
*   **UI Status:** Some UI parts are done (Admin, Shopping Cart, Homepage, Vegetable page), but others need completion (Fruits, **Snacks**, Order Management, Checkout). General feedback on existing UI is positive.
*   **Feature Simplification:** Non-essential features (e.g., SMS opt-in, email promotions, profile picture upload) will be included in the UI but kept non-functional for now to streamline development. Checkout will be simplified (dummy confirmation/COD, no payment gateway integration, no automated emails).
*   **Coding Start:** The team decided to start coding incrementally now, rather than waiting until after Week 7.
*   **Collaboration:** Git repository will be used. Firdaus will initiate it and build the Admin module foundation. VS Code Live Share was mentioned as a potential tool for simultaneous editing.
*   **Project Scope:** Confirmed 5 core modules: User Auth, Product Browsing, Shopping Cart & Checkout, Order Management, Admin Management.
*   **Leadership:** Nora and Amira will act as co-leads to help coordinate and delegate tasks.
*   **Next Meeting:** Scheduled for Tuesday.

**Details**

*   **Week 7 Activity:** Expected to be a physical class where the team presents their project plan and progress (likely using slides based on the proposal).
*   **UI Assignments (Completed):**
    *   Amirah: Vegetable product page UI.
    *   Cris: Admin, Shopping Cart, Homepage UI.
    *   Someone else: Product Category UI (needs adjustment).
*   **UI Assignments (To Be Completed by Tuesday):**
    *   Yalini: Module 2 UI (Product Browsing - specifically Fruits, Snacks pages).
    *   Cris: Module 4 UI (Checkout module).
    *   *Note: The transcript mentions Order Management UI needing to be done, but the final assignments listed only cover Modules 2 & 4. Module 5 (Order Management) UI assignment needs clarification or was missed in the final summary.*
*   **Report/Proposal Document:**
    *   The Introduction section needs to be written/completed.
    *   The Modules/Functions list should be reformatted into a table for better clarity.
*   **Coding Approach:** Firdaus will set up the repository and the basic structure for the Admin module first, allowing others to build upon it. The project will use Django.
*   **Simplification Rationale:** To make the project manageable within the timeframe and focus on core functionality first. Advanced features can potentially be added later if time permits.

**Action Plan (Before Next Meeting on Tuesday)**

1.  **Complete Remaining UI Mockups:**
    *   **Task:** Design UI for Module 2 (Product Browsing - Fruits, Snacks).
    *   **Assignee:** Norah.
    *   **Task:** Design UI for Module 4 (Checkout).
    *   **Assignee:** Cris.
    *   *(Clarification Needed: Assign UI design for Module 5 - Order Management).*
2.  **Complete Report Introduction:**
    *   **Task:** Write/finalize the Introduction section for the project proposal/report.
    *   **Assignee:** Team effort / Co-leads (Norah & Amira) to coordinate.
3.  **Reformat Report Section:**
    *   **Task:** Change the Modules/Functions list in the report into a table format.
    *   **Assignee:** Firdaus (or person handling report formatting).
4.  **Initiate Code Base:**
    *   **Task:** Set up the Git repository for the project.
    *   **Task:** Start developing the foundation/structure for the Admin module code.
    *   **Assignee:** Firdaus.
5.  **Attend Next Meeting:**
    *   **Task:** Reconvene on Tuesday to review progress on UI completion, report updates, and initial coding setup.
    *   **Assignee:** All team members.

This summary should capture the essence of your discussion and provide clear next steps for the team.
