### Key Points Discussed:

1.  **Poster Printing (A2 Size):**
    *   The team wants to print an A2 poster for tomorrow's presentation for better visibility and reference during Q&A.
    *   **Challenge:** Finding a shop that prints A2 is difficult; standard shops often max out at A3. Printing on Sunday adds complexity.
    *   One member can prepare the A2 file preset.
    *   Alternative considered: Printing two A3 sheets and joining them (deemed difficult).
    *   **Contingency Plan:** If A2 printing isn't possible, the team will present using a monitor. Firdaus agreed to bring one if needed.
    *   Paper type needed is standard (~60 GSM), not specialized poster paper.

2.  **Presentation Format & Logistics:**
    *   The format will be a **gallery walk/rotation**.
    *   The team (6 members) will split into three pairs (2 members per pair).
    *   **Rotation:** One pair presents at their station while the other two pairs (4 members) visit and evaluate other groups' presentations. Roles will then rotate so everyone gets to present and evaluate.
    *   **Venue:** Uncertain, possibly the usual classroom. Needs confirmation.
    *   No separate proposal document is required for this presentation.

3.  **Poster Design Review & Finalization:**
    *   **Color Scheme:** Text color changed from white to black on the green background for better clarity. White text decided for diagram elements on dark backgrounds for contrast.
    *   **Font:** Size checked (>30), considered visible.
    *   **Alignment:** Objective 1 alignment requested to be changed to 'left'.
    *   **Content - Mockups:**
        *   Section initially labelled "Veggies" should be relabelled "Product" or "Category" to include vegetables, dairy, fruits, and snacks.
        *   Need specific HD mockup images (Home page, Product/Category page). Amira to provide these. Concerns about image compression via WhatsApp.
        *   Suggestion to potentially increase mockup image size and add section dividers.
    *   **Content - MVC Diagram:** Needs clarification on whether a legend is required for the different colors used (red, green, blue). Nora might have details. Adding one is preferred for clarity.
    *   **Content - Team Members:** Names are included but currently in random order. Suggestion to potentially alphabetize.

4.  **Roles & Order:**
    *   **Round 1 Presenters:** Firdaus & Azfar
    *   **Round 2 Presenters:** Cris & Yalini
    *   **Round 3 Presenters:** Norah & Amira

5.  **Final Approval:** The team generally agreed the current design (with requested changes) looks good.

### Action Plan:

1.  **Poster Designer:**
    *   Implement requested design changes: Left-align Objective 1, use white text for diagrams, potentially add section dividers, potentially increase mockup image size.
    *   Update the mockup section label from "Veggies" to "Product" or "Category".
    *   Incorporate HD mockup images (Home, Product/Category) once received from Amira.
    *   Add a legend to the MVC diagram if color meanings are provided (check with Nora).
    *   Consider alphabetizing team member names.
    *   Prepare the final A2 print-ready file.
    *   Share the final digital poster file (.ai or similar) with the group via WhatsApp.

2.  **Yalini:** Export and send HD mockup images (Home page, Product/Category page) to the poster designer, trying to minimize compression.

3.  **All Team Members:** Actively search for a print shop nearby capable of printing A2 size posters **today/tonight**. Inform the group immediately if a viable option is found.

4.  **Firdaus:** Bring a monitor to the presentation tomorrow as a backup if A2 printing is unsuccessful.

5.  **Amirah:** Share the meeting recording with the team.

6.  **All Team Members:** Confirm the presentation venue. Prepare for assigned presentation slots.

7.  **Decision Point:** Based on success/failure in finding an A2 print shop, decide whether to print the poster or use the monitor backup plan.
