### **Rationale for Security Risk Analysis & Evaluation**
- It is a fundamental part of **Risk Management**.
- **Primary Goal:** To implement **cost-effective** security controls.
- **Consequences of Neglecting Risk Analysis:**
  - **Overspending:** Implementing unnecessary controls based on assumptions.
  - **Under-protection:** Failing to address actual significant threats.
- **Key Concept:** Focus on identifying and managing **significant threats** (higher frequency or impact).
- **Control Philosophy:** Aim for **"Good"** (appropriate, cost-effective) controls, not necessarily the absolute **"Best"** (potentially excessive).
- **Illustrative Examples:**
  - **Home Security:** Budget constraints force prioritization based on likely risks.
  - **UK vs. Malaysia:** Different threat landscapes (e.g., **Terrorism** significance) necessitate different controls; blind copying is wasteful.
  - **Transparent Garbage Bags (UK):** A specific control derived from bomb threat analysis.
  - **Oklahoma City Bombing:** Led to controls like prohibiting parking near critical federal buildings.

### **Fundamental Security Principles (CIA + AAA)**
- **CIA Triad:**
  - **Confidentiality:** Preventing unauthorized disclosure of information.
  - **Integrity:** Ensuring data accuracy, authenticity, and preventing unauthorized modification.
  - **Availability:** Ensuring systems and data are accessible to authorized users when needed.
- **Triple A (AAA):**
  - **Authentication:** Verifying *who* a user is.
    - Methods: Something you **know** (password), **have** (token), **are** (biometrics).
    - Context is key: Higher risk demands stronger authentication (e.g., immigration biometrics).
  - **Authorization:** Determining *what* an authenticated user is allowed to do/access.
  - **Accountability:** Tracking actions (**Who, What, When, Where, Why, How** - 5W1H). Crucial for audits, billing, incident investigation (e.g., **audit logs**).

---
### **Overview: Role of the Information Security Manager**
- Prevent loss, fraud, and sensitive data breaches.
- Ensure **Regulatory Compliance** (e.g., software licenses).
- Manage and update **Security Policies**.
- Ensure **Business Continuity Planning (BCP)**.
- Plan for **Incident & Disaster Response**.
- **Prioritize** Security Initiatives and resource allocation.

---
### **Drivers for Security Initiatives**
- **Audit Findings:** Non-compliance identified in audits drives corrective actions.
- **Technology:** New technologies can address existing weaknesses (e.g., biometrics vs. swipe cards).
- **Compliance:** Laws, regulations, or internal policies mandate specific controls.
- **Security Risk (Assessment):** The systematic process of identifying needs based on risk levels to achieve cost-effectiveness.

---
### **Introduction to Security Risk Assessment (SRA)**
- **Importance of Quality:** A poor SRA leads to faulty conclusions, bias, planning errors, and potentially *increased* risk due to ineffective controls.
- **Core Components (Introduced):**
  - **Asset Valuation:** Understanding the value/criticality of what's being protected.
  - **Threat Analysis:** Identifying potential sources of harm.
  - **Vulnerability Evaluation:** Identifying weaknesses exploitable by threats.
  - **Control Effectiveness Review:** Objectively assessing how well current controls work.
- **Goal:** **Risk Reduction** to an acceptable level (not elimination). Identify **appropriate**, cost-effective controls.

---
### **Overview: Related Security Activities**
- **Gap Analysis:** Comparing current state against a standard/requirement to find deficiencies.
- **Compliance Audit:** Verifying adherence to *required* controls (laws, standards).
- **Security Audit:** Verifying specific security controls are in place and effective.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Identifying known weaknesses in systems/networks.
- **Penetration Testing:** Authorized, simulated attacks to find exploitable flaws.
- **Ad Hoc Testing:** Expert-driven testing for less obvious vulnerabilities.
- **Social Engineering:** Non-technical attacks manipulating people; also used to test awareness.

---
### **Announcements & Key Logistics**
- First 3 weeks of class are **online**.
- Subsequent classes will be **physical** at FSKTM.
- **Assessment:** 50% **Continuous Assessment** (2 Quizzes, 1 Indiv. Assignment, 1 Group Assignment), 50% **Final Exam**.
- Final Exam is **physical** and **Open Book** (lecture notes only).
- Course emphasizes **understanding** concepts over rote memorization.

---
### **Key Takeaways from Week 1**
- Security Risk Analysis is essential for implementing **cost-effective** security, preventing waste and exposure.
- Understanding the **CIA Triad** and **Triple A (AAA)** principles is foundational.
- SRA involves analyzing **assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and controls** to appropriately reduce risk.
- The course blends online/physical sessions and uses varied assessments, culminating in an open-book final exam focused on application.
